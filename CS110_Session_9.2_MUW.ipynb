    "### Q1 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Explain in your own words what the red-black condition is. \n",
    "\n",
    "A: The red-black condition is a rule that every node in a red-black tree must follow in order to maintain the properties of the tree. It states that:\n",
    "- Every node is either red or black.\n",
    "- The root node must be black.\n",
    "- Every leaf (i.e., null pointer) is black.\n",
    "- If a node is red, then both its children must be black.\n",
    "- \"For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes\" Textbook, (2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules ensure that the tree is balanced and that the longest path from the root to a leaf is no more than twice as long as the shortest path. The red-black condition is important because it guarantees that operations on the tree, such as insertion and deletion, can be performed efficiently while maintaining the tree's properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What are the  differences and similarities between RBTs and BSTs? \n",
    "\n",
    "A: RBTs and BSTs are similar in that they are both data structures used for storing and searching data. However, RBTs have additional rules governing the color of each node, which ensure the tree is balanced, while BSTs simply order nodes based on their value. This makes RBTs more efficient for certain operations but also more complex to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Give step-by-step explanations of how the 4 different scenarios involving improper RBTs are rectified during insertion. \n",
    "\n",
    "A: Below: \n",
    "\n",
    "Case 0: z = root -> color black\n",
    "- if the root is z then we just need to color it in black\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 1: z.uncle = red -> recolor\n",
    "- We need to recolor since we will otherwise break the condition of having an equal amount of black height for each node\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 2: z.uncle is = black (triangle) -> rotate z.parent\n",
    "\n",
    "Case 3: z.uncle is black (line) -> rotate z.grandparent & recolor \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q4\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What is the time complexity of insertions to RBTs and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Inserting a node in a Red-Black Tree (RBT) takes O(log n) time, where n is the number of nodes. This is because during insertion, the RBT may need to be rebalanced to maintain its properties, which involves rotating and recoloring nodes. The maximum height of an RBT is O(log n), so the insertion time for a node is also O(log n). Each node may require a constant number of rotations and recolorings (O(1)), and in the worst case, we may need to perform these operations for all nodes in the tree (O(log n)). Therefore, the total time complexity for insertion in RBT is O(log n).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q5 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: What do you notice about how are the properties of red-black trees maintained as changes are made to the tree\n",
    "\n",
    "A: The insertion process is the same as for the BSTs. However, the root can be changed too to maintain the color properties and black height.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q6\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Add the sequence 8, 10, 6, 11, 5, 14, 17 to an empty tree. Now add 18. How is the RBT restructured such that the conditions are maintained?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Once we insert the nodes 8, 10, 6, 11, 5, 14, and 17, the RBT may become unbalanced, violating the Red-Black conditions. To restore balance, we perform a series of rotations and recolorings. In this case, we will perform a Right Rotation on node 10 to make node 11 the root of the subtree, then recolor nodes 10 and 11. This will result in a balanced RBT. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we add the node 18, we first insert it as a red node at the bottom of the tree. Then, we check if any of the Red-Black conditions are violated. In this case, we see that node 18 is a red child of node 17, which is also red. To restore balance, we perform a Left Rotation on node 17, Then, the tree will have a right-leaning red edge between 14 and 17. To fix the red edge, we will perform a color flip: change the color of 14 and 17 to black, and change the color of 15 to red. The tree is now balanced and satisfies all the Red-Black Tree conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q7\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: With the tree as structured after Q6, add 19. How is the RBT restructured such that the conditions are maintained?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: In this case, we need to fix two violations. The first one occurs because the uncle node is red, so we need to adjust the colors and make the parent of node 19 black again. This leads to a second violation in the upper subtree, where we have two adjacent red parent and child nodes. However, since the uncle node has been changed to black, we can resolve this violation by performing a left rotation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q8 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: With the tree as structured after Q7, add 12, then add 15, then delete 8, then delete 10. Now add 13. How is the RBT restructured such that the conditions are maintained?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Node 12 does not require any corrections since its parent is black. Moving on to node 15, it is added as the new root of the right subtree with root 14 and the colors do not violate any properties. Node 8 already exists in the Red-Black Tree but is still added as a left child of the subtree with root 10, and the colors remain valid. However, when adding node 13, it violates the properties of the Red-Black Tree as the uncle is also red. Thus, we must push the blackness up and recolor the grandparent. Despite this, another violation occurs, and once again, the uncle is red, so we must push the blackness up again. Finally, we reach the base case, the root of the tree, which is red and should be colored black. After applying these changes, we return the resulting Red-Black Tree."

    "\n",
    "Q: Exercise 13.1-3 Cormen et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Yes, it is a RBT. We observe that the root of the Red-Black Tree was previously red and satisfies property 4, indicating that its children (also previously red) are black. Changing the color of the root to black, we do not violate any properties, as the count of black nodes along simple paths to the tree's leaf nodes remains the same. This is because the root is only included in these paths in one instance, and changing its color does not affect the count of black nodes in any other paths. Thus, we conclude that the resulting tree is a valid Red-Black Tree.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Q2 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Exercise 13.1-5 Cormen et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \n",
    "\n",
    "To prove that the longest simple path from a node x to a descendant leaf in a red-black tree (RBT) is no more than twice the length of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf, we need to consider two scenarios. In the first scenario, the longest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf comprises only black nodes. In this case, the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf also comprises only black nodes since all paths from a node to a descendant leaf in an RBT must have the same number of black nodes. Hence, the longest simple path in this scenario has precisely twice the length of the shortest simple path. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the second scenario, the longest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf includes at least one red node. In this scenario, the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf has no red nodes since red nodes can only appear in pairs along a path in an RBT. Let L be the length of the longest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf, and let S be the length of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf. Since the longest simple path comprises at least one red node, it can be divided into two parts: a red node followed by a black node (which may be the descendant leaf), and a path from the black node to the descendant leaf. Let L1 be the length of the path from node x to the red node, and let L2 be the length of the path from the black node to the descendant leaf. We can express L as L1 + L2 + 1 since we count the red node as part of the longest simple path and S as L2 since the shortest simple path has no red nodes. Additionally, since the red node has a black child (otherwise the longest simple path would comprise only black nodes), L1 is no greater than the length of the shortest simple path to a black descendant leaf, which is S.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "L = L1 + L2 + 1 <= S + L - L1 + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplifying this, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 <= (L - S + 1) / 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Since L1 is at most this value and L1 is also at most S (since the red node has a black child), we can conclude that:\n",
    "\n",
    "L1 <= min(S, (L - S + 1) / 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "Substituting this, we get:\n",
    "\n",
    "L <= S + L - min(S, (L - S + 1) / 2) + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Simplified:\n",
    "\n",
    "L <= 2S + 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Above, I showed that the longest simple path from a node x in an RBT to a descendant leaf has length at most twice that of the shortest simple path from node x to a descendant leaf, for any node x in the tree structure. \n",

    "### Q3 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Exercise 13.1-6 Cormen et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \n",
    "\n",
    "The black-height of a RBT refers to the number of black nodes on any path from the root to a leaf. In order to maximize the number of internal nodes in an RBT with black-height k, we want to create a tree that is as full as possible. A full binary tree of height h has 2^(h+1) - 1 nodes, so the formula for the largest possible number of internal nodes in an RBT with black-height k is N_max = 2^(k+1) - 1 - k. This formula subtracts k from the total number of nodes to exclude the k leaves that must be present in any RBT with black-height k.\n",
    "\n",
    "To minimize the number of internal nodes in an RBT with black-height k, we want to create a tree that is as sparse as possible. One way to achieve this is by alternating black and red nodes on each level, starting with a black node at the root. This creates a tree where every path from the root to a leaf has the same number of black nodes, but there are no internal nodes with two children. In this tree, the black nodes at each level form a complete binary tree of height k, and there are 2^k - 1 black nodes at each level. The red nodes are inserted in between the black nodes on every level, so there are 2^(k-1) - 1 red nodes at each level. The total number of nodes in the tree is thus N_min = (2^k - 1) + (2^(k-1) - 1) = 3 * 2^(k-1) - 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the formula for the largest possible number of internal nodes in an RBT with black-height k is N_max = 2^(k+1) - 1 - k, and the formula for the smallest possible number of internal nodes in an RBT with black-height k is N_min = 3 * 2^(k-1) - 1.\n",

    "### Q4\n",
    "\n",
    "Q: Left-Right Balance\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \n",
    "\n",
    "If a BST can be colored as a RBT without issues, it means that there is a limit on how much the left and right subtrees can be unbalanced. This is because RBTs have certain balancing properties that ensure the tree is somewhat balanced, which restricts the degree of imbalance in the left and right subtrees.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an RBT, all leaves in the tree have the same number of black nodes on the path from that leaf to the root. This means that the height difference between the left and right subtrees of any node in the RBT can be at most one. Since the total height of the tree is O(log n) for a tree with n nodes, this implies that the ratio of the number of nodes in the left subtree to the number of nodes in the right subtree is restricted by a constant factor.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming that there are n nodes in the RBT and the height of the tree is h, the height of the tree is at most 2 log(n+1) and at least log(n+1)/2. Because the ratio of the number of nodes in the left subtree to the number of nodes in the right subtree at any node is at most h+1 and at least (h+1)/2, we can conclude that:\n",
    "\n",
    "log(n+1)/2 <= left-right balance <= 2log(n+1)\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the left-right balance of an RBT is bounded by O(log n) when n is the number of nodes in the tree. As the number of nodes in the RBT increases, the bound on the left-right balance does not change, because the height of the tree is always O(log n), regardless of the number of nodes. However, the constant factors in the bound may change as the structure of the tree changes.\n",

    "### Q5 \n",
    "\n",
    "Q: From Binary Search Trees to Red-Black Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "A: \n",
    "\n",
    "To make the Node class suitable for Red-Black Trees (RBTs), we need to introduce several new properties and functions to represent the color of the node and maintain the necessary properties of an RBT. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Adding a \"color\" attribute to the Node class to indicate whether the node is red or black.\n",
    "- Adding a \"parent\" attribute to the Node class to represent the parent node of the current node.\n",
    "- Implementing a new \"is_red()\" method to determine whether the current node is red.\n",
    "- Implementing a new \"is_black()\" method to determine whether the current node is black.\n",
    "- Adding a \"set_color()\" method to update the color of the current node.\n",
    "- Adding a \"get_color()\" method to retrieve the color of the current node.\n",
    "- Adding a \"get_parent()\" method to retrieve the parent of the current node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also need to modify the \"insert()\" method to insert nodes while adhering to the rules of an RBT. This involves making sure that the root is always black, ensuring that no red node has a red child, and performing any necessary rotations to maintain the tree's balance. Additionally, we need to include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A new \"rotate_left()\" method to perform a left rotation on the current node and its child nodes.\n",
    "- A new \"rotate_right()\" method to perform a right rotation on the current node and its child nodes."
