    "Q: What is the role of randomization in the efficiency of several operations supported by a randomly-generated BST?\n",
    "\n",
    "A: Randomization has an important role in the efficiency of several operations supported by a randomly-generated BST. A randomly-generated BST ensures that the height of the tree is balanced on average, which results in an O(log n) time complexity for operations such as search, insertion, and deletion. In contrast, an unbalanced BST could lead to a worst-case time complexity of O(n) for these operations. Also, randomization allows for better distribution of nodes, reducing the likelihood of skewness in the tree. This ensures that each node's left and right subtree are roughly the same size, leading to better performance for operations such as selection and rank. Overall, randomization helps to maintain the balance and efficiency of the BST."
